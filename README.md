# Bézier Extractions

Computation of Bézier extraction matrices, as described in
[(Borden et al, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.2968),
with some simple tests showing how to use it.

Uses [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) and
the tests also use [my geometry library](https://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/).
